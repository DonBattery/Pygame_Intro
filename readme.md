A brief intro to the wonderful, open-source, cross-platform Pygame Python library, 
which provide all the tools needed to create a nice 2D game or any other multi-media application using Python

This library is based on the popular Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library which provides a rather powerful cross-platform
hardware abstraction layer for game and multi-media development

Pygame was created by Peter Shinners (now a lead developer at Blizzard) in the early 2000. From 2005 it is a community based project
under the GNU Lesser General Public License, which means you can use it for private or commercial purposes as long as you keep your
Pygame-library related code available for your users...

In this repo you will find some examples and descriptions on how things work in the world of Pygame

Happy codeing!

and do not forget : pip install pygame
